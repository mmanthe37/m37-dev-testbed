## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Depending on what you're working with, you may need:
- **Node.js** (v18+) and npm/yarn for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- **Python** (3.8+) for Python projects
- **Swift** and Xcode for iOS/macOS projects
- **Git** for version control

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mmanthe37/m37-dev-testbed.git
   cd m37-dev-testbed
   ```

2. **Choose your path**
   - Start a new experiment in `/experiments`
   - Use a template from `/templates` to kickstart a project
   - Explore existing prototypes in `/prototypes`

3. **Use the templates**
   ```bash
   # Copy a template to start a new project
   cp -r templates/react-nextjs experiments/my-new-project
   cd experiments/my-new-project
   npm install
   ```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Create** - Start in `/experiments` or use a template
2. **Develop** - Build and iterate rapidly
3. **Test** - Use automated testing and linting
4. **Document** - Keep notes in `/research` or `/docs`
5. **Promote** - Move successful experiments to `/prototypes` or `/apps`
6. **Deploy** - When ready, deploy from `/apps`

## 📝 Templates

Ready-to-use templates are available in `/templates`:

- **react-nextjs/** - React with Next.js 15+ App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **swift-swiftui/** - SwiftUI app with MVVM architecture
- **python-script/** - Python script with proper structure and best practices

Each template includes:
- Basic project structure
- Configuration files
- Example code
- README with setup instructions

## 🧪 Linting and Code Quality

This repository uses automated linting via GitHub Actions:
- **ESLint** for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **SwiftLint** for Swift code (when applicable)
- **Black** for Python code (when applicable)

Run linting locally:
```bash
npm run lint          # For JavaScript/TypeScript projects
