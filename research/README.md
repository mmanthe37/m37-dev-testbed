## Best Practices

1. **Be Thorough**: Include all relevant information and sources
2. **Stay Organized**: Use clear folder and file naming
3. **Keep Updated**: Review and update research periodically
4. **Cite Sources**: Always reference where information came from
5. **Include Examples**: Code examples help illustrate concepts
6. **Use Markdown**: For easy reading and version control

## Documentation Format

Each research topic should include:
- **Overview**: What is being researched
- **Motivation**: Why this research is important
- **Findings**: Key discoveries and insights
- **Examples**: Code snippets or demonstrations
- **Conclusions**: Summary and recommendations
- **References**: Links to sources and further reading

## Tips

- Use tables for comparisons
- Include diagrams for architecture
- Add code snippets for examples
- Link to related experiments or prototypes
- Tag research with dates for context
