# Experiments

This directory is for quick experiments and technology explorations.

## Purpose

Use this space for:
- Testing new libraries and frameworks
- Quick proof-of-concepts
- Learning exercises
- Technology feasibility studies
- API integration tests

## Structure

Organize experiments by:
- Technology type (e.g., `react-hooks/`, `python-ml/`)
- Date or project name
- Feature being tested

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Simple**: Experiments should be focused and lightweight
2. **Document Findings**: Add a README in each experiment folder
3. **Clean Up**: Archive or delete experiments that are no longer needed
4. **Graduate Success**: Move successful experiments to `/prototypes` or `/apps`

## Example Structure

```
experiments/
├── react-server-components/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── app/
├── python-async-io/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── test.py
└── swift-combine/
    ├── README.md
    └── CombineTest.swift
```

## Tips

- Use the templates from `/templates` as starting points
- Keep experiments isolated and self-contained
- Document what you learned, even if the experiment failed
- Consider time-boxing experiments to avoid getting stuck
